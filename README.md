## CIS3301-CODE-18-The-Guessing-Game

## Instructions

In CODE 1, at the beginning of the semester, you were asked to program a little guessing game. In this game, you were asked to create a game where a user attempted to guess a number, and the game will return the success on it.

Your job in this code assignment is to transform that guessing game into an object oriented program.

## Requirements

Your program should have the following requirements.

1. Player object
  * Attributes: name and kind (i.e., type)
  * Method: guess (returns the random of a computer or requests and returns a guess from the user).
2. Game object
  * Attributes: player, number of tries, and number to guess (from 1 to 10).
  * Method: play (executes all the game logic for the game and returns false the game needs to stop).
